Q: Tell me a project that you are proud of ?

A: As you know, Lazada severs for 6 countries in south east Asia.
So there are different languages in each country.
Here we don't use specific text in our project, instead we use 
an object with a key and defaultMessage to represent the text.

The workflow is extract, upload, translation, and compile the final 
language kit to our project.

For extract step, I develop a babel & webpack plugin to make the work automated.

The first step is to split the articles to N segments. and then count each segments.

Now we get the most possible words combination of each language.

Now give a specific sentenceï¼Œ we use the same method to split the language.
